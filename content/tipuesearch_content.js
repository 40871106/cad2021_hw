It really was revolutionary at the time, when all other popular CAD systems are in the  Unix  build on  .  After several years of development, the initial version of SolidWorks has finally arrived... \n introduce: \n The original version was released in 1995, and its features are as follows. \n 1. Compared with other CAD systems at 18,000 USD, the price of SolidWorks is only 4,000 USD. \n 2. The software is easier to use: Compared with other CAD software on the market, users only need 3 months of experience to get started. \n \xa0 A large part of the ease of use is that it uses a modern and well-known Windows interface. \n 3. The visualization of the model is unprecedented.  The architectural function in the well-lit shadow environment is in sharp contrast with the traditional modeling space. \n \xa0 The traditional modeling space only displays the wire frame under the black background.  The similar FeatureManager that we are now familiar with is used to display the construction history of the model. \n 4. Parts, assemblies and drawings are available from the beginning.
